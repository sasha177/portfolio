                     <p style="font-size: 16px;">Hi! My name is Sasha Mittal and I'm a freshman at Dublin High School. My passions include basketball (I'm on the school team), piano, Model United Nations/competitive debate, and service to our community. I have had a great deal of exposure to technology and engineering. I am currently enrolled in computer science engineering at my high school, and am eager to continue pursueing this subject in the future as well. I intend to continue to take computer science and engineering classes in during my four years at Dublin High.<br><br> 
                     My passion for community service grew in 7th grade, when I applied for an officer position in the California Junior Scholarship Federation (CJSF). CJSF is a community service club dedicated towards giving back to the community and those in need. After a lengthy interview and application process, I was elected as the communications secretary. I contacted local businesses for donations, advertised our events, kept our members updated, and planned numerous volunteering events and fundraisers. I was eventually elected for the Huhn Scholarship Award, for which I was recognized for my commitment towards helping others. Not only am I an open minded individual, but I also do well under pressure and am a team player who maintains a cheerful atmosphere around others.<br><br>Altogether, I am an individual who is willing to put in the time and effort necessary in order to perform my best in school and extracurriculars. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Feel free to look around the rest of my website, including my resume, projects, and where to contact me.</p>
